# Expanding_universe
A short and silly code to visually guide students through the theory that the universe has no specific center of expansion.

When cosmology enthusiasts try to think about big bang, they often have trouble understanding that the universe has no specific point from which the astronoical bodies seem to go farther away.
On the contrary, Every point in the observable universe tend to move away from every other point.
A basic comparison would be the raisins inside a bread that is being baked, or Dots on the surface of the balloon that is being inflated.
Though I won't say no to a baked bread if served in real life, our code is far more of an eye-candy.

This is made jointly by Bhaskar Dutta, yours truly, and Rounak Adhikary, who is too lazy to sign in in Github.

This is made with Opencv.

Directions: Run it. when you see a nice screen filled with circular stars, press any key twice.
then you will see the image of the star filled screen shown previously, superimposed with a same image,slightly small. This shows a map of stars and what they looked like a few million years ago.

move the stars with a,s,d,w. And see a pattern form.

So, what is the center of the pattern?
why does it change as soon as you move the image?
Draw your own conclusions.

Made originally to demonstrate to kids in the JUSC TechKnowCradle 2017.
